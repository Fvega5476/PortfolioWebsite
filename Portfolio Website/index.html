        <p>Being in the tech industry has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Since the very first Android and iPhone released back in 2007-2008, Apps were also introduced alongside these devices. I wondered how was it possible for someone to turn an idea of innovation into something digital that could fit right in your pocket, well all you really needed was the desire to learn and a bit of coding practice. Coding has since then changed my life into understanding computer science in a much more simpler way. There’s still so much to learn and my passion and inspiration grow just by imagining the possibilities waiting to be developed and created by us, the programmers!</p>
